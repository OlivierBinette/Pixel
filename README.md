# Pixel
Prototype of a 2d web game engine. The rendering and animation system works, but physics has not been implemented. Created in 2014.

A simple demonstration (Flappy Bird clone) runs on Firefox (press [space] to fly).

The graphic art is not mine and is used for learning and testing purposes only.
